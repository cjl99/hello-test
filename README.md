State-of-the-art Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods

Fine-tuning large pretrained models is often prohibitively costly due to their scale. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods enable efficient adaptation of large pretrained models to various downstream applications by only fine-tuning a small number of (extra) model parameters instead of all the model's parameters. This significantly decreases the computational and storage costs. Recent state-of-the-art PEFT techniques achieve performance comparable to fully fine-tuned models.

PEFT is integrated with Transformers for easy model training and inference, Diffusers for conveniently managing different adapters, and Accelerate for distributed training and inference for really big models.

Tip

Visit the PEFT organization to read about the PEFT methods implemented in the library and to see notebooks demonstrating how to apply these methods to a variety of downstream tasks. Click the "Watch repos" button on the organization page to be notified of newly implemented methods and notebooks!

Check the PEFT Adapters API Reference section for a list of supported PEFT methods, and read the Adapters, Soft prompts, and IA3 conceptual guides to learn more about how these methods work.

Quickstart
Install PEFT from pip:

pip install peft
Prepare a model for training with a PEFT method such as LoRA by wrapping the base model and PEFT configuration with get_peft_model. For the bigscience/mt0-large model, you're only training 0.19% of the parameters!

from transformers import AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM
from peft import get_peft_config, get_peft_model, LoraConfig, TaskType
model_name_or_path = "bigscience/mt0-large"
tokenizer_name_or_path = "bigscience/mt0-large"

peft_config = LoraConfig(
    task_type=TaskType.SEQ_2_SEQ_LM, inference_mode=False, r=8, lora_alpha=32, lora_dropout=0.1
)

model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(model_name_or_path)
model = get_peft_model(model, peft_config)
model.print_trainable_parameters()
"trainable params: 2359296 || all params: 1231940608 || trainable%: 0.19151053100118282"
To load a PEFT model for inference:

from peft import AutoPeftModelForCausalLM
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
import torch

model = AutoPeftModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("ybelkada/opt-350m-lora").to("cuda")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("facebook/opt-350m")

model.eval()
inputs = tokenizer("Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and place the cookie dough", return_tensors="pt")

outputs = model.generate(input_ids=inputs["input_ids"].to("cuda"), max_new_tokens=50)
print(tokenizer.batch_decode(outputs, skip_special_tokens=True)[0])

"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and place the cookie dough in the center of the oven. In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon. In a separate bowl, combine the egg yolks, sugar, and vanilla."
Why you should use PEFT
There are many benefits of using PEFT but the main one is the huge savings in compute and storage, making PEFT applicable to many different use cases.

High performance on consumer hardware
Consider the memory requirements for training the following models on the ought/raft/twitter_complaints dataset with an A100 80GB GPU with more than 64GB of CPU RAM.

Model	Full Finetuning	PEFT-LoRA PyTorch	PEFT-LoRA DeepSpeed with CPU Offloading
bigscience/T0_3B (3B params)	47.14GB GPU / 2.96GB CPU	14.4GB GPU / 2.96GB CPU	9.8GB GPU / 17.8GB CPU
bigscience/mt0-xxl (12B params)	OOM GPU	56GB GPU / 3GB CPU	22GB GPU / 52GB CPU
bigscience/bloomz-7b1 (7B params)	OOM GPU	32GB GPU / 3.8GB CPU	18.1GB GPU / 35GB CPU
With LoRA you can fully finetune a 12B parameter model that would've otherwise run out of memory on the 80GB GPU, and comfortably fit and train a 3B parameter model. When you look at the 3B parameter model's performance, it is comparable to a fully finetuned model at a fraction of the GPU memory.

Tip

The bigscience/T0_3B model performance isn't optimized in the table above. You can squeeze even more performance out of it by playing around with the input instruction templates, LoRA hyperparameters, and other training related hyperparameters. The final checkpoint size of this model is just 19MB compared to 11GB of the full bigscience/T0_3B model. Learn more about the advantages of finetuning with PEFT in this blog post.
